Title: Face Mask Detection Using CNN with VGG16 in Keras

In today's rapidly changing world, the integration of technology and safety measures has never been more critical. The Face Mask Detection project presents an innovative solution, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the VGG16 architecture in Keras to address a crucial aspect of public health. The primary goal of this project is to automatically identify individuals wearing face masks in real-time, leveraging advanced computer vision techniques.

The project workflow commences with meticulous data preprocessing, encompassing image loading and standardization. To optimize model performance, the dataset undergoes shuffling and division into training and testing sets, facilitated by the versatile train_test_split function from sci-kit-learn. Subsequently, a robust CNN model is meticulously crafted, harnessing the prowess of the VGG16 architecture as an adept feature extractor. While fine-tuning the model to adapt to the face mask detection task, we strategically freeze layers to preserve the valuable features learned by VGG16.

The model's training phase is resource-intensive, requiring approximately 3 hours of computation. Upon completion, it consistently and accurately distinguishes between individuals with and without face masks, highlighting the potential of AI and computer vision to enforce safety protocols and mitigate health risks in public spaces.
